## Description

__THIS IS NOT THE END. ONE MORE URL AND YOU WILL FINISH THE GAME!__

## Attachments

- [Download File](https://sourcing.games/games/02s/one-more-url.docx "one-more-url.docx")
- [Mirror](files/one-more-url.docx "one-more-url.docx")

## Instructions

Use password from file.

_If you are Mac user, maybe itâ€™s time to call your friends with Windows. They have more experience with Word. ðŸ˜‰_

## Solution

### LibreOffice Writer

There a file named `one-more-url.docx` and we should use the password from the file to continue the game.

Opening the file, we only see a single smile emoji. In this case I use LibreOffice Writer to open the file because I'm using Linux.

![Smile Emoji Docx](images/smile-emoji-docx.webp#center "Smile Emoji Docx")

Since the content is only a smile emoji, I suspect that there is something hidden in the file or there is something in the metadata.

So I look the document properties in LibreOffice Writer by clicking `File` > `Properties`.

![File](images/file-menu.webp#center "File")

In `General` tab there is nothing interesting other than creation date that created on `12/13/2016`, `15:34:00` and the author is `@jantegze` with hashtag `#SourcingGames`. But it is not the password/flag.

![Properties General](images/properties-general.webp#center "Properties General")

Then I go to `Description` tab and there is a `Title` with value `Interesting, right? :)`. But it is not the password/flag.

![Properties Description](images/properties-description.webp#center "Properties Description")

Then I go to `Custom Properties` tab and there is a `Company` with value `42sourcer`.

![Properties Custom](images/properties-custom.webp#center "Properties Custom")

I try to use `42sourcer` as the password and it works.

### Microsoft Word

You can simply right-click the file and choose `Properties` > `Details` tab.

![File Properties Details](images/file-properties.webp#center "File Properties Details")

Also if you are using Microsoft Word, you can open the file and go to `File` > `Info` > `Properties` > `Advanced Properties` > `Summary` tab. Also you can just click the `Show All Properties` button.
