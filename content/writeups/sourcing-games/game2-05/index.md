## Description

The first part of the e-mail address of this [GitHub user](https://github.com/angularjs-gdit) is the password that will open the file below. (Use only the part before @)
The password that is in that file will open the next level.


NOTE: DO NOT contact this GitHub user for any hints or your account/IP will be blocked!

## Instructions

Type password from the file.

## Solution

So we have to find the first part of the e-mail address of the GitHub user [angularjs-gdit](https://github.com/angularjs-gdit) in order to open the password-protected Microsoft Word document (docx) file.

Visiting the GitHub profile, we can see the user is not displaying their e-mail address in the profile section.

![GitHub Profile](images/github-profile.webp#center)

The next step is to search the e-mail address of the user in the public repos, commits, issues, and pull requests.

I found one interesting repository, [angularjs-gdit/slideshow](https://github.com/angularjs-gdit/slideshow), which contains a PowerPoint presentation file (pptx) named [`angularjs.pptx`](files/angularjs.pptx). But, no e-mail address was found in the file.

![pptx](images/pptx.webp#center)

When I checked the commits of the latest repository, also no e-mail address was found in the commit messages. Usually some developers sign their commits with their e-mail address using the `-s` flag (e.g. `git commit -s -m "commit message"`) these features are using GPG keys to sign the commits.

![commits](images/commits.webp#center)

I also checked the issues and pull requests, but no e-mail address was found.

Then, I remembered that GitHub has a feature that allows users to check commit patches. So to view the patch of the latest commit, I visited the latest commit page and added `.patch` at the end of the URL.

https://github.com/angularjs-gdit/example-01-helloworld/commit/4243528ac995e2bb717eed82b06fea620ab7f0f2.patch

![patch](images/patch.webp#center)

And there it is, the e-mail address of the user is `pt103368@PT103368.corp.int`. But we only need the first part of the e-mail address, which is `pt103368`.

Another way to find the e-mail address is by using the `git log` command. First, clone the repository using the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angularjs-gdit/example-01-helloworld.git
```

![git clone 1](images/git-clone1.webp#center)

![git clone 2](images/git-clone2.webp#center)

Then navigate to the cloned repository

```bash
cd example-01-helloworld
```

and use the following command to view the commit history.

```bash
git log
```

![git log 1](images/git-log1.webp#center)

or to view it in a specific format, you can use the following command.

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h %an %ae" -1
```

![git log 2](images/git-log2.webp#center)

The command above will display the commit hash, author name, and author e-mail address of the latest commit.

So we got the first part of the e-mail address, which is `pt103368`. Now we can use it to open the password-protected Microsoft Word document (docx) file.

When the file is opened, we can see the password to open the next level.

## Extras

For GitHub OSINT stuff I made a script/tools to automate the process, you can find it [here](https://github.com/hiiruki/ghosint). It's called `ghosint` which the name is coming from "GitHub OSINT". It's a simple Python script that uses the GitHub API to gather information about a user or an organization. This tools requires a GitHub API token to work.

The information that can be gathered are:

- User Information:
  - Username
  - Name
  - ID
  - Node ID
  - Gravatar ID
  - Location
  - Bio
  - Email
  - Twitter
  - Company
  - Hireable
  - Organizations
  - Followers
  - Following
  - Type
  - Created at
  - Updated at

- Repo Information
  - Public Repos
  - Public Gists
  - GitHub Gist

- Screenshots

For more information about the script, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hiiruki/ghosint).
