## Intro

When I use Arch Linux, I have a problem with font rendering in Firefox and other applications. The font is shown as boxes. This is because the font is not installed or not configured correctly. In this article, I will show you how to fix this problem.

## Steps

### 1. Install Required Fonts

```bash
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts noto-fonts-extra noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-cjk ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation
```

![noto-fonts](./images/install-fonts.webp#center)

> â“˜ NOTE:<br>
> Although `noto-fonts` is installed by default in Arch Linux, it may not be installed in some cases. So, you should install it manually. And `noto-fonts-extra`, `noto-fonts-emoji`, and `noto-fonts-cjk` are also needed to display some special characters. (Tho it's actually included as a dependency of [`noto-fonts`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/noto-fonts/)). `ttf-dejavu` and `ttf-liberation` are also needed to display some characters.

### 2. Refresh font cache

Pacman has already done this for you, but you can do it manually if you want.

```bash
fc-cache -f -v
```

![fc-cache](./images/fc-cache.webp#center)

This command will refresh the font cache. `-f` is to force the regeneration of the cache. `-v` is to show the progress.

### 3. Restart Firefox or other applications

After you have done the above steps, you should restart Firefox or other applications to see the changes.

### 4. (Optional) Change font settings in Firefox

If you still have problems with font rendering in Firefox, you can change the font settings in Firefox.

#### 1. Open Firefox

#### 2. Go to Settings

#### 3. Search for `fonts` or just scroll down to the `Fonts` section

   ![Firefox Settings](./images/firefox-settings.webp#center)

   You can use the Default (DejaVu) or use the Noto fonts.

#### 4. Advanced settings

Make sure you check the `Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above` option to let the websites use their own fonts.
